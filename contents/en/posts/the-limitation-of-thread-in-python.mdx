description: "What are the differences between threads in Python and threads in other programming languages? What is the GIL? Is it always more efficient to use multithreading and multiprocessing over single-threading and single-processing? In this article, I will discuss the limitations of threads in Python and provide recommendations on when to use multithreading, multiprocessing, or stick with single-threading."

# Properties of Thread and Process in Python

### Thread

- Cannot run multiple threads at the same time
- When fork a new thread, the code segment and global data segment are shared between threads → no time is wasted like forking a new process

### Process

- When fork a new process, the entire data and code segment are copied to the new process → time-consuming

# Benchmark

**There are 2 types of tasks in Python:**

- interactivity with IO such as calling HTTP API, reading files,… - IO bounded
- complex computation, using multiple CPUs - CPU bounded

**There are 2 parallel processing methods in Python:**

- multithreading
- multiprocessing

We use the following program to test the efficiency of multithreading/single-threading and multiprocessing/single-processing in the 2 types of tasks.

- **measure** function is used to measure the execution time of a function.
- **fib** function is the Fibonacci number calculation function, representing the task that uses multiple CPUs.
- **get_user** function is the function that calls the API from Github, representing the IO-bound task.

```python
import threading
import multiprocessing
import time
import requests

def measure(func):
    def f(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        ret = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} takes {time.time()-start} seconds")
        return ret

    return f


def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    
def get_user():
    return requests.get("https://api.github.com/users/magiskboy")


@measure
def cpu_bounded_in_multiple_process():
    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=fib, args=(40,), daemon=True)
    p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=fib, args=(40,), daemon=True)
    p1.start()
    p2.start()
    p1.join()
    p2.join()


@measure
def cpu_bounded_in_multiple_thread():
    t1 = threading.Thread(target=fib, args=(40,), daemon=True)
    t2 = threading.Thread(target=fib, args=(40,), daemon=True)
    t1.start()
    t2.start()
    t1.join()
    t2.join()


@measure
def cpu_bounded_in_single_thread():
    fib(40)
    fib(40)


@measure
def io_bounded_in_single_thread(n_iters=10):
    for i in range(n_iters):
        get_user()


@measure
def io_bounded_in_multiple_threads(n_iters=10):
    ts = []
    for i in range(n_iters):
        t = threading.Thread(
            target=get_user,
            daemon=True,
        )
        t.start()
        ts.append(t)

    for t in ts:
        t.join()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    cpu_bounded_in_single_thread()
    cpu_bounded_in_multiple_thread()
    cpu_bounded_in_multiple_process()
    io_bounded_in_single_thread()
    io_bounded_in_multiple_threads()
```

# Observations

- For IO-bound tasks, multithreading is more efficient than single-threading.
- For CPU-bound tasks, multiprocessing is more efficient than multithreading.
- For CPU-bound tasks, single-threading is more efficient than multithreading.

# Q&A

Q: Why is multithreading more efficient than single-threading for IO-bound tasks even though we cannot run multiple threads at the same time in Python?

A: In IO-bound tasks that do not use CPU, when a thread is locked, that thread is still **considered running** because the time locked overlaps with the time waiting for the IO result. Therefore, parallelism is partially guaranteed.

Q: Why is multiprocessing more efficient than multithreading for CPU-bound tasks?

A: In Python there is no multithreading because only 1 thread can run at a time. With multiprocessing, multiple processes can run at the same time.

Q: For tasks that use multiple CPUs, why is single-threading more efficient than multithreading?

A: In Python, only 1 thread can run at a time, so even if multiple threads are running, parallel processing does not occur. In fact, multithreading is less efficient in this case because of the context switching overhead.

# GIL - Global Interpreter Lock

GIL is a mutex lock used to ensure that only 1 thread is executed at a time.

Mutex lock will lock the entire data segment of the entire process for other threads and only the executing thread can access that data segment.

Only use 1 mutex lock for the entire data of the process has 2 reasons:

- avoid deadlock
- reduce the cost of updating the status of mutex locks, avoiding overhead

You can read mor about GIL in here [https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Python/ceval_gil.c#L14](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Python/ceval_gil.c#L14)

# Conclusion

- For tasks that require a lot of IO interaction, use multithreading.
- For tasks that require computation, need more CPU, do not use multithreading but optimize the program to process single-threaded. In addition, you can use multiprocessing if the problem is really "heavy".
